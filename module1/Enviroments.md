# Development Environments

A common practice is for teams to have a developer environment, a UAT or QA environment, and a staging environment. The main purpose of this flow is to find any potential issues that may arise due to changes or new features being added to the codebase.

# Staging

The staging environment should mimic your production environment.
This allows teams to spot or find any potential issues prior to them getting to production.

- New Features
- Testing
- Migrations
- Configuration Changes

# Production

It's out there for people to see and/or interact with. Any issues or problems you may have had should have been caught and fixed in the staging environment.
